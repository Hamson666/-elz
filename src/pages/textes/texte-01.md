My past selves died and left me behind them  
I wish to vanish as they did  
I feel alone, cold and fragile  
When all the things i did, all the people i knew, all the places i went are strangers to me  
Please kill my mind and keep my body  
Sublimate it and keep my nerves sharp  
My senses are all i know now  
I want them to fill the whole word  
Touch my skin it's made of the rocks of the walls of the homes i once knew  
Pull my hair they're charged with the songs and the music the air carried to me  
Fill my mouth it's full of the kisses and the words that never left  
Kill my mind and keep my body  
May it be the art i wished to be  
May it be the art i wished to make  
May it be the art i'm meant to be
